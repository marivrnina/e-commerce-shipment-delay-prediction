# E-Commerce Shipment Delay Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting e-commerce shipment delays using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify whether a shipment will arrive on time or be delayed based on operational and customer-related features.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance  
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler  

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Handling imbalanced classes using SMOTE  
- Model training and comparison  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
